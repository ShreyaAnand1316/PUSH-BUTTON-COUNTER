*OVERVIEW* :

Project Overview : 
The project involves using a push button to increment a counter.
A temperature sensor reads the current temperature.
The temperature data is displayed on an LCD screen or a serial monitor.
Deliverables include circuit design, code, and output demonstration.

Components Required : 
1)Microcontroller (Arduino Uno, ESP8266, or ESP32)
2)Push Button
3)Resistor (10kΩ for pull-down configuration)
4)Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11, or DS18B20)
5)LCD Display (16x2 LCD with I2C module or OLED)
6)Breadboard & Jumper Wires
7)Power Source (5V)

Uses and Applications : 
Learning Embedded Systems – Helps in understanding microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and display control.
Digital Event Counting – Can be used in places where counting button presses (e.g., attendance tracking, object counting) is required.
Temperature Monitoring – Useful in applications where temperature readings need to be continuously monitored.
IoT and Automation – Can be extended by integrating with WiFi modules (ESP8266/ESP32) for remote monitoring.
Industry and Research – Used for tracking events along with environmental monitoring in various experiments.
