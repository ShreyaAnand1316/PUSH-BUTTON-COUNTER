*OVERVIEW* :

Project Overview : 
The Push Button Counter with LCD Display project is a simple embedded system that tracks the number of button presses and displays the count on a 16x2 LCD. It utilizes a microcontroller, a push button, and an LCD display to visually represent the number of button presses. The system is designed to detect button presses accurately using debounce logic and provides real-time feedback.


Components Required : 

1)Microcontroller: Arduino Nano (or any similar microcontroller with digital I/O support).

2)Push Button: For user input.

3)Resistor (510kΩ): For pull-down configuration to stabilize button input.

4)16x2 LCD Display: Used to display the button count.

5)Connecting Wires: To establish connections between components.

6)Breadboard: For prototyping and testing the circuit.



Uses and Applications : 

-Learning Embedded Systems – Helps in understanding microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and display control.

-Digital Event Counting – Can be used in places where counting button presses (e.g., attendance tracking, object counting) is required.
-Temperature Monitoring – Useful in applications where temperature readings need to be continuously monitored.

-IoT and Automation – Can be extended by integrating with WiFi modules (ESP8266/ESP32) for remote monitoring.

-Industry and Research – Used for tracking events along with environmental monitoring in various experiments.
